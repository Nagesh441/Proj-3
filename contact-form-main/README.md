# Responsive Contact Form

This project is a responsive contact form implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to work well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Form validation
- Custom popup message on successful submission
- Clean and modern user interface

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the contact form
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the form and making it responsive
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling form submission and displaying the popup

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the contact form.

## Customization

You can easily customize this form by modifying the following:

- Colors: Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css` to change the color scheme.
- Fields: Modify the form fields in `index.html` to add or remove input fields as needed.
- Validation: Adjust the form validation logic in `script.js` if you change the form fields.
- Popup message: Customize the success message in both `index.html` and `script.js`.

## Browser Support

This form should work in all modern browsers, including:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Development

To make changes to the project:

1. Edit the HTML in `index.html` to modify the structure.
2. Update styles in `styles.css` to change the appearance.
3. Modify `script.js` to alter the form submission behavior or validation.

## Notes

- This is a front-end only implementation. To make it functional, you'll need to add backend logic to process the form data.
- Ensure all fields are properly sanitized and validated on the server-side if you implement a backend.
